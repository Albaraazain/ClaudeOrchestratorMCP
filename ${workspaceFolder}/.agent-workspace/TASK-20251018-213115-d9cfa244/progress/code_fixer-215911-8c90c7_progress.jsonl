Evidence: (1) Line 1355 fixed with resolve_workspace_variables(WORKSPACE_BASE), (2) All 11 WORKSPACE_BASE usages analyzed and documented in report, (3) Approach B (runtime fix) successfully implemented - surgical one-line change as requested, (4) Fix verified logically with test cases, (5) Other WORKSPACE_BASE usages documented with fix status and reasoning, (6) Coordinated with registry_merger (completed), task_migrator (50% complete), and post_fix_verifier (30% complete). Registry merger completed successfully - 9 tasks unified. Post_fix_verifier correctly identified this is a partial fix (Approach B) but it addresses the critical task creation path. For complete fix, Approach C (move function to line 27, fix line 38) can be implemented in future refactor.", "progress": 100}
