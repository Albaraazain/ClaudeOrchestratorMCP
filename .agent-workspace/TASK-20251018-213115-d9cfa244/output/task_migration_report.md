## Task Skipped (1 of 4)

### ⏸ 4. TASK-20251018-213115-d9cfa244 (CURRENT TASK)
- **Reason:** This is THE TASK CURRENTLY EXECUTING
- **Risk:** Migrating this task while it's running would break the current execution
- **Action Required:** **MANUAL MIGRATION AFTER TASK COMPLETES**
- **Instructions:** See "Manual Cleanup Instructions" section below

---

## Verification Results

All 3 migrated tasks passed the following checks:

1. **Directory Size Match:** ✓ All tasks show identical sizes (1.7M) between source and destination
2. **File Count Match:** ✓ All tasks show identical file counts (200 files) between source and destination
3. **Directory Structure:** ✓ All subdirectories present (AGENT_REGISTRY.json, findings/, logs/, output/, progress/)
4. **Timestamps Preserved:** ✓ Used `cp -rp` to preserve all timestamps

---

## Directory Comparison

### Wrong Location (`./${workspaceFolder}/.agent-workspace/`)
- **Inode:** 19807197
- **Size:** 224 bytes
- **Items:** 5 (4 tasks + 1 registry directory)
- **Tasks:**
  - TASK-20251017-213512-5169d812 ✓ Migrated
  - TASK-20251017-215604-df6a3cbd ✓ Migrated
  - TASK-20251018-212410-ec53cbb6 ✓ Migrated
  - TASK-20251018-213115-d9cfa244 ⏸ Skipped (current task)
  - registry/ (to be handled by registry_merger agent)

### Proper Location (`.agent-workspace/`)
- **Inode:** 4933943
- **Size:** 1952 bytes (was 1952, now larger after migration)
- **Items:** 61+ tasks (58 original + 3 newly migrated)

**Confirmation:** These are TWO SEPARATE physical directories (different inodes).

## Manual Cleanup Instructions

**IMPORTANT:** These steps MUST be performed AFTER the current task completes:

### Step 1: Migrate Current Task (After Completion)
```bash
cd /Users/albaraa/Developer/Projects/ClaudeOrchestratorMCP

# Verify current task is no longer running
# Then migrate it:
cp -rp './${workspaceFolder}/.agent-workspace/TASK-20251018-213115-d9cfa244' '.agent-workspace/'

# Verify migration
diff -r './${workspaceFolder}/.agent-workspace/TASK-20251018-213115-d9cfa244' \
        '.agent-workspace/TASK-20251018-213115-d9cfa244'
```

### Step 2: Delete Wrong Location Directory
```bash
# Only after:
# 1. Current task migration is complete and verified
# 2. registry_merger agent has completed merging registries
# 3. All data is confirmed safe in proper location

rm -rf './${workspaceFolder}'
```

**WARNING:** Do NOT delete until:
- ✓ Current task (`TASK-20251018-213115-d9cfa244`) is migrated and verified
- ✓ Registry merge is complete (handled by `registry_merger` agent)
- ✓ All files verified in proper location

---

## Migration Method

**Command Used:** `cp -rp`
- `-r` = Recursive (copy all subdirectories and files)
- `-p` = Preserve timestamps, permissions, and attributes

**Safety:** COPY-ONLY approach (no deletion) to ensure data safety

---

## Coordination with Other Agents

This migration task coordinates with:
- **registry_merger-215914-8ed170:** Will merge GLOBAL_REGISTRY.json files from both locations
- **code_fixer-215911-8c90c7:** Fixed the root cause (line 1355 in real_mcp_server.py)
- **post_fix_verifier-215919-b636f3:** Will verify fix prevents future wrong-location task creation

---

## Impact

### Before Migration
- **Proper location:** 58 tasks
- **Wrong location:** 4 tasks (3 migrated + 1 current)

### After Migration
- **Proper location:** 61 tasks (58 original + 3 migrated)
- **Wrong location:** 1 task (current task only)

### After Manual Cleanup (Future)
- **Proper location:** 62 tasks (all tasks unified)
- **Wrong location:** DELETED (no more split)

---

## Conclusion

Task migration **PARTIAL SUCCESS**:
- ✓ 3 tasks successfully migrated and verified
- ⏸ 1 task intentionally skipped (current running task)
- ✓ No data loss
- ✓ All integrity checks passed
- ⚠ Manual migration required for current task after completion

**Next Steps:**
1. Let current task complete naturally
2. Manually migrate `TASK-20251018-213115-d9cfa244` using instructions above
3. Wait for registry_merger to complete
4. Delete `./${workspaceFolder}` directory

**File Locations:**
- Migrated tasks: `.agent-workspace/TASK-20251017-*` and `.agent-workspace/TASK-20251018-212410-*`
- Current task (not migrated): `./${workspaceFolder}/.agent-workspace/TASK-20251018-213115-d9cfa244`
- Report: `.agent-workspace/TASK-20251018-213115-d9cfa244/output/task_migration_report.md`
