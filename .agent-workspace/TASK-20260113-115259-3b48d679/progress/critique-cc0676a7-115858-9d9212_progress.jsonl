Key findings: (1) Architectural concern - SQLite migration 60% complete creating hybrid state, (2) Review flow design incomplete - needs_revision verdict ignored, (3) Error handling inconsistent across codebase with 30+ bare except blocks, (4) Race conditions are symptoms of incomplete migration, (5) SQLite transaction handling is excellent - proper pattern throughout. Submitted 10 observations spanning architectural, technical debt, and security concerns with 8 actionable recommendations prioritized by timeframe.", "progress": 100}
