Delivered: (1) architecture_analysis.md - comprehensive 541-line document mapping all 8 @mcp.tool functions, 3 @mcp.resource functions, 2 helper functions with full dependency graph, risk assessment, and best practices. (2) dependency_diagram.txt - visual ASCII diagram showing call hierarchy and identifying 1 CRITICAL bug (spawn_child_agent:2336 missing .fn) and 1 MEDIUM risk (get_task_resource:2355 may need .fn). Verified NO circular dependencies. Confirmed existing code at lines 2246, 2305 is CORRECT (calls helper function, not @mcp.tool). Evidence: All function calls analyzed with specific line numbers and code patterns documented.", "progress": 100}
