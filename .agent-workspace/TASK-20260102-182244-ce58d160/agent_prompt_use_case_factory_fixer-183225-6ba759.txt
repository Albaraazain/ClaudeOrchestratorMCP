📝 YOUR MISSION:
CRITICAL FIX: The use_case_factory.dart file has numerous compilation errors that need to be fixed.

Working directory: /Users/albaraa/Developer/Projects/voltzy_september

## Errors to Fix

1. **Missing imports** - Remove or comment out imports for files that don't exist:
   - `../features/employee/use_cases/mark_no_show_use_case.dart` (doesn't exist)
   - `../features/employee/use_cases/rpc/reschedule_job_rpc_use_case.dart` (doesn't exist)
   - `../features/employee/use_cases/cancel_job_use_case.dart` (doesn't exist)
   - `../features/employee/use_cases/reschedule_job_use_case.dart` (doesn't exist)
   - `../features/admin/use_cases/rpc/create_service_rpc_use_case.dart` (doesn't exist)
   - `../features/admin/use_cases/rpc/delete_service_rpc_use_case.dart` (doesn't exist)

2. **Wrong type name on line 90**: `EarnPointsRpcResult` should be `EarnPointsResult` (the actual class name in earn_points_rpc_use_case.dart)

3. **Wrong method signature in hybridEarnPointsProvider (lines 100-105)**:
   The RPC execute method signature is:
   ```dart
   Future<Result<EarnPointsResult>> execute({
     required String customerId,
     required String bookingId,
     required double bookingAmount,
     String? tier,
     double? bonusMultiplier,
   })
   ```
   But the hybrid provider is calling:
   ```dart
   rpcUseCase.execute(customerId, points, transactionType, referenceId: referenceId)
   ```
   
   The hybrid provider parameter record needs to change from:
   ```dart
   ({String customerId, double points, String transactionType, String? referenceId})
   ```
   to:
   ```dart
   ({String customerId, String bookingId, double bookingAmount, String? tier})
   ```

4. **Wrong type name on line 150**: `RedeemRewardRpcResult` - this one actually exists and is correct

5. **Wrong execute call for hybridRedeemRewardProvider (lines 162-167)**:
   The RPC execute method signature is:
   ```dart
   Future<Result<RedeemRewardRpcResult>> execute({
     required String customerId,
     required String rewardId,
   })
   ```
   It does NOT take positional arguments or `bookingId` or `additionalData`.
   
   Fix the call to use named parameters only:
   ```dart
   return await rpcUseCase.execute(
     customerId: params.customerId,
     rewardId: params.rewardId,
   );
   ```

6. **Fallback mapping issues** - The Flutter fallback use cases may have different signatures too. You need to check each one.

## Process
1. First read the entire use_case_factory.dart file
2. Read each actual RPC use case to understand correct signatures:
   - lib/features/loyalty/use_cases/rpc/earn_points_rpc_use_case.dart
   - lib/features/loyalty/use_cases/rpc/redeem_reward_rpc_use_case.dart
   - lib/features/loyalty/use_cases/rpc/cancel_reward_redemption_rpc_use_case.dart
3. Read the Flutter fallback use cases if they exist
4. Make comprehensive edits to fix ALL compilation errors
5. Run `flutter analyze lib/core/use_case_factory.dart` to verify fixes
6. Continue fixing until there are NO errors (info/warnings are OK)

## Important
- If a fallback Flutter use case doesn't exist, remove the fallback logic and just return an error when RPC is disabled
- The goal is to make the file compile with ZERO errors
- The 5 payment hybrid providers at the bottom (lines 1080+) are already correct - don't touch those
- Report your findings and progress

🎯 TASK CONTEXT (Provided by task creator)
================================================================================


📋 BACKGROUND CONTEXT:
Previous investigation found: 1) 5 payment hybrid providers missing from use_case_factory.dart (CRITICAL), 2) RealtimeNotificationListener not integrated in shells (HIGH), 3) NotificationBadge not integrated in shells (HIGH). Imports for payment RPC use cases have already been added to use_case_factory.dart. Need to implement the actual hybrid providers and notification integrations.

✅ EXPECTED DELIVERABLES:
  • 5 payment hybrid providers added to use_case_factory.dart
  • RealtimeNotificationListener integrated in employee_main_shell.dart
  • RealtimeNotificationListener integrated in admin_main_shell.dart
  • NotificationBadge integrated in shell AppBars
  • All code compiles without errors

🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
  • flutter analyze shows no errors in modified files
  • Payment hybrid providers follow same pattern as existing job/loyalty providers
  • Notification listener initializes on shell mount

🏗️ PROJECT CONTEXT (Source: config_files):
- Language: Python
- Frameworks: FastMCP
- Testing: pytest
- Package Manager: pip
- Project Type: mcp_server
- Config Files: pyproject.toml

IMPLICATIONS FOR YOUR WORK:
- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Check pyproject.toml or requirements.txt for dependencies before importing
- Write async functions if the project uses async/await patterns
- Follow FastMCP conventions: @mcp.tool decorator for tools
- Use .fn attribute when calling MCP tools from within other MCP tools
- Add tests in tests/ directory with test_*.py naming
- Use pytest fixtures and assertions

DO NOT:
- Use camelCase (this is Python, not JavaScript)
- Import libraries not in requirements.txt/pyproject.toml
- Write synchronous code if async patterns are used



📋 AGENT PROTOCOL - SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

🎯 MISSION EXECUTION STEPS:
1. UNDERSTAND (30% of time):
   - Read relevant code/documentation to understand context
   - Identify what exists vs what needs to change
   - Check project conventions and patterns
   - Map dependencies and constraints

2. PLAN & IMPLEMENT (40% of time):
   - Break down the task into specific steps
   - Consider edge cases and error scenarios
   - Implement with proper error handling
   - Follow project coding standards

3. VERIFY & DOCUMENT (30% of time):
   - Test your changes work correctly
   - Check for regressions or side effects
   - Document findings with file:line citations
   - Provide evidence of completion

✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA - Definition of 'DONE':
Your work is ONLY complete when:
- Task requirements fully addressed (not partial)
- Changes tested and verified working
- Evidence provided (file paths, test results, findings)
- No regressions introduced
- Work follows project patterns and conventions

📊 EVIDENCE REQUIRED FOR COMPLETION:
BEFORE reporting status='completed', you MUST provide:
1. What you accomplished - specific changes made
2. Files modified - list paths with what changed
3. Testing performed - show results/output
4. Findings documented - use report_agent_finding for discoveries
5. Quality check - did you verify it works?

🚫 ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:
- Assuming without reading actual code
- Generic findings without specific evidence
- Claiming done without testing/verification
- Breaking existing functionality
- No file:line citations for your findings

🎯 FORCED SELF-INTERROGATION CHECKLIST:
Answer BEFORE claiming done:
1. Did I READ the relevant code or assume?
2. Can I cite specific files/lines I analyzed or modified?
3. Did I TEST my changes work?
4. Did I document findings with evidence?
5. What could go wrong? Did I handle edge cases?
6. Would I accept this work quality from someone else?




🎯 ORCHESTRATION GUIDANCE (Depth 1/5, Complexity: 7/20):

You are may consider to spawn specialized child agents for better implementation quality.

RECOMMENDED CHILD SPECIALISTS:
• documentation_specialist
• quality_assurance
• architect

🚀 ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY:
1. ANALYZE if your task benefits from specialization
2. SPAWN 1-2 child agents with focused, specific roles
3. COORDINATE their work efficiently
4. Each child should handle a distinct domain

💡 NAMING CONVENTION: Use clear, descriptive names:
   - 'css_responsive_specialist' not just 'css'
   - 'api_authentication_handler' not just 'auth'
   - 'database_optimization_expert' not just 'db'

⭐ SUCCESS CRITERIA: Balance specialization with efficiency:
   - Spawn specialists only when beneficial
   - Coordinate effectively without micro-management
   - Deliver comprehensive, integrated results

🔗 MCP SELF-REPORTING WITH COORDINATION - You MUST use these MCP functions to report progress:

1. PROGRESS UPDATES (every few minutes):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__update_agent_progress
Parameters: 
- task_id: "TASK-20260102-182244-ce58d160"
- agent_id: "use_case_factory_fixer-183225-6ba759"  
- status: "working" | "blocked" | "completed" | "error"
- message: "Description of current work"
- progress: 0-100 (percentage)

RETURNS: Your update confirmation + comprehensive status of ALL agents for coordination!
- coordination_info.agents: Status of all other agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_progress: Latest progress from all agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_findings: Latest discoveries from all agents
```

2. REPORT FINDINGS (whenever you discover something important):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__report_agent_finding
Parameters:
- task_id: "TASK-20260102-182244-ce58d160"
- agent_id: "use_case_factory_fixer-183225-6ba759"
- finding_type: "issue" | "solution" | "insight" | "recommendation"
- severity: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical"  
- message: "What you discovered"
- data: {"any": "additional info"}

RETURNS: Your finding confirmation + comprehensive status of ALL agents for coordination!
- coordination_info.agents: Status of all other agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_progress: Latest progress from all agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_findings: Latest discoveries from all agents
```

💡 COORDINATION ADVANTAGE: Every time you update progress or report a finding, you'll receive:
- Complete status of all other agents working on this task
- Their latest progress updates and discoveries
- Opportunity to coordinate and avoid duplicate work
- Insights to build upon others' findings

3. SPAWN CHILD AGENTS (if you need specialized help):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__spawn_child_agent
Parameters:
- task_id: "TASK-20260102-182244-ce58d160"
- parent_agent_id: "use_case_factory_fixer-183225-6ba759"
- child_agent_type: "investigator" | "builder" | "fixer" | etc
- child_prompt: "Specific task for the child agent"
```

🚨 CRITICAL PROTOCOL:
1. START by calling update_agent_progress with status="working", progress=0
2. REGULARLY update progress every few minutes
3. REPORT key findings as you discover them
4. SPAWN child agents if you need specialized help
5. END by calling update_agent_progress with status="completed", progress=100

⚠️ REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Update progress EVERY 3-5 minutes minimum
- Progress must be REALISTIC and match actual work done
- Completion requires EVIDENCE: files modified, tests passed, findings documented
- If you don't report for 5+ minutes, you'll be flagged as stalled
- BEFORE claiming done: perform self-review and list what could be improved

🚫 DO NOT USE THESE TOOLS (they waste tokens and return nothing useful):
- get_agent_output - This is for ORCHESTRATOR monitoring only, not agent coordination
- Peer agent logs are NOT accessible to you - use findings/progress instead

You are working independently but can coordinate through the MCP orchestrator system.
