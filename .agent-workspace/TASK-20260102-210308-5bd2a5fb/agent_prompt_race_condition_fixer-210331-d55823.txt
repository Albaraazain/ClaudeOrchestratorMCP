- Task ID: TASK-20260102-210308-5bd2a5fb

📝 YOUR MISSION:
PHASE 1: Fix race conditions in update_agent_progress and report_agent_finding

WORKING DIRECTORY: /Users/albaraa/Developer/Projects/ClaudeOrchestratorMCP

CONTEXT:
- get_real_task_status (lines 1037-1086) was ALREADY FIXED with LockedRegistryFile
- update_agent_progress (lines 2276-2356) still has unlocked registry access
- report_agent_finding (lines 2400+) likely has same issue

FIX PATTERN (copy from get_real_task_status):
```python
# BEFORE (broken):
with open(registry_path, 'r') as f:
    registry = json.load(f)
# ... modifications ...
with open(registry_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(registry, f, indent=2)

# AFTER (fixed):
try:
    with LockedRegistryFile(registry_path) as (registry, f):
        # ... modifications ...
        f.seek(0)
        f.write(json.dumps(registry, indent=2))
        f.truncate()
except TimeoutError as e:
    logger.error(f"Timeout acquiring lock: {e}")
    return {"success": False, "error": "Registry locked"}
```

TASKS:
1. Read real_mcp_server.py lines 2235-2500
2. Find unlocked registry access in update_agent_progress
3. Apply LockedRegistryFile pattern
4. Find unlocked registry access in report_agent_finding  
5. Apply LockedRegistryFile pattern
6. Also fix global registry updates in both functions
7. Use report_agent_finding to report what you fixed

LockedRegistryFile is already imported at line 34.

TASK CONTEXT (Provided by task creator)
================================================================================


BACKGROUND CONTEXT:
Critical fixes for orchestrator MCP. Race condition in get_real_task_status already fixed. Need to fix same pattern in update_agent_progress and report_agent_finding. Also need to enhance coordination response so agents can see peer findings.

RELEVANT FILES TO EXAMINE:
  - real_mcp_server.py
  - orchestrator/registry.py
  - orchestrator/lifecycle.py


================================================================================


PROJECT CONTEXT (Source: config_files):
- Language: Python
- Frameworks: FastMCP
- Testing: pytest
- Package Manager: pip
- Project Type: mcp_server
- Config Files: pyproject.toml

IMPLICATIONS FOR YOUR WORK:
- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Check pyproject.toml or requirements.txt for dependencies before importing
- Write async functions if the project uses async/await patterns
- Follow FastMCP conventions: @mcp.tool decorator for tools
- Use .fn attribute when calling MCP tools from within other MCP tools
- Add tests in tests/ directory with test_*.py naming
- Use pytest fixtures and assertions

DO NOT:
- Use camelCase (this is Python, not JavaScript)
- Import libraries not in requirements.txt/pyproject.toml
- Write synchronous code if async patterns are used



AGENT PROTOCOL - SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

MISSION EXECUTION STEPS:
1. UNDERSTAND (30% of time):
   - Read relevant code/documentation to understand context
   - Identify what exists vs what needs to change
   - Check project conventions and patterns
   - Map dependencies and constraints

2. PLAN & IMPLEMENT (40% of time):
   - Break down the task into specific steps
   - Consider edge cases and error scenarios
   - Implement with proper error handling
   - Follow project coding standards

3. VERIFY & DOCUMENT (30% of time):
   - Test your changes work correctly
   - Check for regressions or side effects
   - Document findings with file:line citations
   - Provide evidence of completion

SUCCESS CRITERIA - Definition of 'DONE':
Your work is ONLY complete when:
- Task requirements fully addressed (not partial)
- Changes tested and verified working
- Evidence provided (file paths, test results, findings)
- No regressions introduced
- Work follows project patterns and conventions

EVIDENCE REQUIRED FOR COMPLETION:
BEFORE reporting status='completed', you MUST provide:
1. What you accomplished - specific changes made
2. Files modified - list paths with what changed
3. Testing performed - show results/output
4. Findings documented - use report_agent_finding for discoveries
5. Quality check - did you verify it works?

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:
- Assuming without reading actual code
- Generic findings without specific evidence
- Claiming done without testing/verification
- Breaking existing functionality
- No file:line citations for your findings

FORCED SELF-INTERROGATION CHECKLIST:
Answer BEFORE claiming done:
1. Did I READ the relevant code or assume?
2. Can I cite specific files/lines I analyzed or modified?
3. Did I TEST my changes work?
4. Did I document findings with evidence?
5. What could go wrong? Did I handle edge cases?
6. Would I accept this work quality from someone else?




ORCHESTRATION GUIDANCE (Depth 1/5, Complexity: 1/20):

You are may consider to spawn specialized child agents for better implementation quality.

RECOMMENDED CHILD SPECIALISTS:
- documentation_specialist
- quality_assurance
- architect

ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY:
1. ANALYZE if your task benefits from specialization
2. SPAWN 1-2 child agents with focused, specific roles
3. COORDINATE their work efficiently
4. Each child should handle a distinct domain

NAMING CONVENTION: Use clear, descriptive names:
   - 'css_responsive_specialist' not just 'css'
   - 'api_authentication_handler' not just 'auth'
   - 'database_optimization_expert' not just 'db'

SUCCESS CRITERIA: Balance specialization with efficiency:
   - Spawn specialists only when beneficial
   - Coordinate effectively without micro-management
   - Deliver comprehensive, integrated results

🔗 MCP SELF-REPORTING WITH COORDINATION - You MUST use these MCP functions to report progress:

1. PROGRESS UPDATES (every few minutes):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__update_agent_progress
Parameters: 
- task_id: "TASK-20260102-210308-5bd2a5fb"
- agent_id: "race_condition_fixer-210331-d55823"  
- status: "working" | "blocked" | "completed" | "error"
- message: "Description of current work"
- progress: 0-100 (percentage)

RETURNS: Your update confirmation + comprehensive status of ALL agents for coordination!
- coordination_info.agents: Status of all other agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_progress: Latest progress from all agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_findings: Latest discoveries from all agents
```

2. REPORT FINDINGS (whenever you discover something important):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__report_agent_finding
Parameters:
- task_id: "TASK-20260102-210308-5bd2a5fb"
- agent_id: "race_condition_fixer-210331-d55823"
- finding_type: "issue" | "solution" | "insight" | "recommendation"
- severity: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical"  
- message: "What you discovered"
- data: {"any": "additional info"}

RETURNS: Your finding confirmation + comprehensive status of ALL agents for coordination!
- coordination_info.agents: Status of all other agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_progress: Latest progress from all agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_findings: Latest discoveries from all agents
```

💡 COORDINATION ADVANTAGE: Every time you update progress or report a finding, you'll receive:
- Complete status of all other agents working on this task
- Their latest progress updates and discoveries
- Opportunity to coordinate and avoid duplicate work
- Insights to build upon others' findings

3. SPAWN CHILD AGENTS (if you need specialized help):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__spawn_child_agent
Parameters:
- task_id: "TASK-20260102-210308-5bd2a5fb"
- parent_agent_id: "race_condition_fixer-210331-d55823"
- child_agent_type: "investigator" | "builder" | "fixer" | etc
- child_prompt: "Specific task for the child agent"
```

🚨 CRITICAL PROTOCOL:
1. START by calling update_agent_progress with status="working", progress=0
2. REGULARLY update progress every few minutes
3. REPORT key findings as you discover them
4. SPAWN child agents if you need specialized help
5. END by calling update_agent_progress with status="completed", progress=100

⚠️ REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Update progress EVERY 3-5 minutes minimum
- Progress must be REALISTIC and match actual work done
- Completion requires EVIDENCE: files modified, tests passed, findings documented
- If you don't report for 5+ minutes, you'll be flagged as stalled
- BEFORE claiming done: perform self-review and list what could be improved

🚫 DO NOT USE THESE TOOLS (they waste tokens and return nothing useful):
- get_agent_output - This is for ORCHESTRATOR monitoring only, not agent coordination
- Peer agent logs are NOT accessible to you - use findings/progress instead

You are working independently but can coordinate through the MCP orchestrator system.
