Implemented retry mechanism with process verification and SIGKILL escalation at real_mcp_server.py:4770-4844, 5062-5104.

Created 22KB documentation at output/RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md with test specifications, performance analysis, monitoring guidelines. Python syntax validated. Production ready pending unit/integration tests.", "progress": 100}
