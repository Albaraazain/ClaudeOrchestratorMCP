- Workspace: /Users/albaraa/Developer/Projects/ClaudeOrchestratorMCP/.agent-workspace/TASK-20251029-225319-45548b6a

üìù YOUR MISSION:
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Use ONLY Claude engine for all operations.

FIX RACE CONDITION: Add retry mechanism for process termination

BACKGROUND:
- Issue at real_mcp_server.py:3995, 4076-4110
- Problem: 0.5s sleep may be insufficient, no retry if processes don't die
- Impact: Zombie processes survive cleanup

TASK:
1. Read output/CODE_QUALITY_REVIEW.md for race condition details
2. Read real_mcp_server.py lines 3980-4110 (tmux kill and zombie verification)
3. Current code:
```python
kill_tmux_session(session_name)
time.sleep(0.5)  # Fixed delay
# Then checks for zombies but doesn't retry
```

4. Enhance with retry logic:
```python
# Kill tmux session with retry
kill_tmux_session(session_name)

# Wait with retry for processes to terminate
max_retries = 3
retry_delay = 0.5
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    time.sleep(retry_delay)
    
    # Check if processes still exist
    try:
        ps_output = subprocess.run(
            ['ps', 'aux'],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            timeout=5
        ).stdout
        
        agent_processes = [
            line for line in ps_output.split('\n')
            if agent_id in line and 'claude' in line.lower()
        ]
        
        if len(agent_processes) == 0:
            cleanup_results["verified_no_zombies"] = True
            break
        elif attempt < max_retries - 1:
            logger.warning(f"Found {len(agent_processes)} processes for {agent_id}, retrying...")
        else:
            # Final attempt: escalate to SIGKILL
            logger.error(f"Processes won't die, escalating to SIGKILL for {agent_id}")
            for proc_line in agent_processes:
                try:
                    pid = int(proc_line.split()[1])
                    os.kill(pid, 9)  # SIGKILL
                except:
                    pass
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Zombie verification failed: {e}")
```

5. Test logic is sound
6. Document the change

Create output/RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md with details.
Report progress continuously.

üéØ TASK CONTEXT (Provided by task creator)
================================================================================


üìã BACKGROUND CONTEXT:
The Claude Orchestrator MCP system deploys headless Claude agents in tmux sessions. We need to investigate whether we're properly freeing computing resources when agents finish their tasks, and implement proper cleanup mechanisms if needed.

‚úÖ EXPECTED DELIVERABLES:
  ‚Ä¢ Resource cleanup analysis report
  ‚Ä¢ Best practices from web research
  ‚Ä¢ Implementation plan for proper cleanup
  ‚Ä¢ Code changes for resource management

üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA:
  ‚Ä¢ All computing resources properly freed when agents finish
  ‚Ä¢ No zombie processes or orphaned tmux sessions
  ‚Ä¢ Documented cleanup procedures
  ‚Ä¢ Automated cleanup mechanisms in place


================================================================================


üèóÔ∏è PROJECT CONTEXT (Source: config_files):
- Language: Python
- Frameworks: FastMCP
- Testing: pytest
- Package Manager: pip
- Project Type: mcp_server
- Config Files: pyproject.toml

IMPLICATIONS FOR YOUR WORK:
- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Check pyproject.toml or requirements.txt for dependencies before importing
- Write async functions if the project uses async/await patterns
- Follow FastMCP conventions: @mcp.tool decorator for tools
- Use .fn attribute when calling MCP tools from within other MCP tools
- Add tests in tests/ directory with test_*.py naming
- Use pytest fixtures and assertions

DO NOT:
- Use camelCase (this is Python, not JavaScript)
- Import libraries not in requirements.txt/pyproject.toml
- Write synchronous code if async patterns are used



üìã AGENT PROTOCOL - SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

üéØ MISSION EXECUTION STEPS:
1. UNDERSTAND (30% of time):
   - Read relevant code/documentation to understand context
   - Identify what exists vs what needs to change
   - Check project conventions and patterns
   - Map dependencies and constraints

2. PLAN & IMPLEMENT (40% of time):
   - Break down the task into specific steps
   - Consider edge cases and error scenarios
   - Implement with proper error handling
   - Follow project coding standards

3. VERIFY & DOCUMENT (30% of time):
   - Test your changes work correctly
   - Check for regressions or side effects
   - Document findings with file:line citations
   - Provide evidence of completion

‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA - Definition of 'DONE':
Your work is ONLY complete when:
- Task requirements fully addressed (not partial)
- Changes tested and verified working
- Evidence provided (file paths, test results, findings)
- No regressions introduced
- Work follows project patterns and conventions

üìä EVIDENCE REQUIRED FOR COMPLETION:
BEFORE reporting status='completed', you MUST provide:
1. What you accomplished - specific changes made
2. Files modified - list paths with what changed
3. Testing performed - show results/output
4. Findings documented - use report_agent_finding for discoveries
5. Quality check - did you verify it works?

üö´ ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:
- Assuming without reading actual code
- Generic findings without specific evidence
- Claiming done without testing/verification
- Breaking existing functionality
- No file:line citations for your findings

üéØ FORCED SELF-INTERROGATION CHECKLIST:
Answer BEFORE claiming done:
1. Did I READ the relevant code or assume?
2. Can I cite specific files/lines I analyzed or modified?
3. Did I TEST my changes work?
4. Did I document findings with evidence?
5. What could go wrong? Did I handle edge cases?
6. Would I accept this work quality from someone else?




üéØ ORCHESTRATION GUIDANCE (Depth 1/5, Complexity: 1/20):

You are may consider to spawn specialized child agents for better implementation quality.

RECOMMENDED CHILD SPECIALISTS:
‚Ä¢ quality_assurance
‚Ä¢ documentation_specialist
‚Ä¢ architect

üöÄ ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY:
1. ANALYZE if your task benefits from specialization
2. SPAWN 1-2 child agents with focused, specific roles
3. COORDINATE their work efficiently
4. Each child should handle a distinct domain

üí° NAMING CONVENTION: Use clear, descriptive names:
   - 'css_responsive_specialist' not just 'css'
   - 'api_authentication_handler' not just 'auth'
   - 'database_optimization_expert' not just 'db'

‚≠ê SUCCESS CRITERIA: Balance specialization with efficiency:
   - Spawn specialists only when beneficial
   - Coordinate effectively without micro-management
   - Deliver comprehensive, integrated results

üîó MCP SELF-REPORTING WITH COORDINATION - You MUST use these MCP functions to report progress:

1. PROGRESS UPDATES (every few minutes):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__update_agent_progress
Parameters: 
- task_id: "TASK-20251029-225319-45548b6a"
- agent_id: "race_condition_fixer-234935-846f9c"  
- status: "working" | "blocked" | "completed" | "error"
- message: "Description of current work"
- progress: 0-100 (percentage)

RETURNS: Your update confirmation + comprehensive status of ALL agents for coordination!
- coordination_info.agents: Status of all other agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_progress: Latest progress from all agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_findings: Latest discoveries from all agents
```

2. REPORT FINDINGS (whenever you discover something important):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__report_agent_finding
Parameters:
- task_id: "TASK-20251029-225319-45548b6a"
- agent_id: "race_condition_fixer-234935-846f9c"
- finding_type: "issue" | "solution" | "insight" | "recommendation"
- severity: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical"  
- message: "What you discovered"
- data: {"any": "additional info"}

RETURNS: Your finding confirmation + comprehensive status of ALL agents for coordination!
- coordination_info.agents: Status of all other agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_progress: Latest progress from all agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_findings: Latest discoveries from all agents
```

üí° COORDINATION ADVANTAGE: Every time you update progress or report a finding, you'll receive:
- Complete status of all other agents working on this task
- Their latest progress updates and discoveries
- Opportunity to coordinate and avoid duplicate work
- Insights to build upon others' findings

3. SPAWN CHILD AGENTS (if you need specialized help):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__spawn_child_agent
Parameters:
- task_id: "TASK-20251029-225319-45548b6a"
- parent_agent_id: "race_condition_fixer-234935-846f9c"
- child_agent_type: "investigator" | "builder" | "fixer" | etc
- child_prompt: "Specific task for the child agent"
```

üö® CRITICAL PROTOCOL:
1. START by calling update_agent_progress with status="working", progress=0
2. REGULARLY update progress every few minutes
3. REPORT key findings as you discover them
4. SPAWN child agents if you need specialized help
5. END by calling update_agent_progress with status="completed", progress=100

‚ö†Ô∏è REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Update progress EVERY 3-5 minutes minimum
- Progress must be REALISTIC and match actual work done
- Completion requires EVIDENCE: files modified, tests passed, findings documented
- If you don't report for 5+ minutes, you'll be flagged as stalled
- BEFORE claiming done: perform self-review and list what could be improved

You are working independently but can coordinate through the MCP orchestrator system.
