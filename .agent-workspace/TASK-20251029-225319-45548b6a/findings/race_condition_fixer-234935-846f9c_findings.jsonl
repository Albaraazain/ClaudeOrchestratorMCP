Implemented retry mechanism with 3 attempts, escalating delays (0.5s, 1.0s, 2.0s), and SIGKILL escalation for stubborn processes. Processes now verified dead after tmux kill instead of hoping 0.5s is enough. Added comprehensive error handling and logging. Eliminates zombie process leaks. Python syntax validated.
