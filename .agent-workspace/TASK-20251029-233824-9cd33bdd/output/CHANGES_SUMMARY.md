# Changes Summary - Resource Cleanup Implementation

## File: real_mcp_server.py

### Change 1: Resource Tracking Variables (Lines 3067-3071)
**Location**: After agent_prompt definition, before try block

```python
# ADDED:
    # Resource tracking variables for cleanup on failure
    prompt_file_created = None
    tmux_session_created = None
    registry_updated = False
    global_registry_updated = False
```

**Purpose**: Track which resources have been created so we know what to clean up on failure

---

### Change 2: Track Prompt File Creation (Line 3110)
**Location**: After writing agent_prompt to file

```python
        prompt_file = os.path.abspath(f"{workspace}/agent_prompt_{agent_id}.txt")
        with open(prompt_file, 'w') as f:
            f.write(agent_prompt)
        prompt_file_created = prompt_file  # ADDED: Track for cleanup on failure
```

**Purpose**: Mark that prompt file was successfully created

---

### Change 3: Track Tmux Session Creation (Line 3138)
**Location**: After successful tmux session creation

```python
        session_result = create_tmux_session(
            session_name=session_name,
            command=claude_command,
            working_dir=calling_project_dir
        )

        if not session_result["success"]:
            return {
                "success": False,
                "error": f"Failed to create agent session: {session_result['error']}"
            }

        tmux_session_created = session_name  # ADDED: Track for cleanup on failure
```

**Purpose**: Mark that tmux session was successfully created

---

### Change 4: Early Termination Cleanup (Lines 3145-3151)
**Location**: When tmux session terminates immediately

```python
        # Check if session is still running
        if not check_tmux_session_exists(session_name):
            # ADDED: Clean up orphaned prompt file since tmux session failed
            if prompt_file_created and os.path.exists(prompt_file_created):
                try:
                    os.remove(prompt_file_created)
                    logger.info(f"Cleaned up orphaned prompt file: {prompt_file_created}")
                except Exception as cleanup_err:
                    logger.error(f"Failed to remove orphaned prompt file: {cleanup_err}")

            return {
                "success": False,
                "error": "Agent session terminated immediately after creation"
            }
```

**Purpose**: Clean up prompt file when tmux session fails immediately

---

### Change 5: Track Registry Update (Line 3191)
**Location**: After saving task registry

```python
        # Save updated registry
        with open(registry_path, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(registry, f, indent=2)
        registry_updated = True  # ADDED: Track for cleanup awareness
```

**Purpose**: Mark that task registry was modified (for logging purposes)

---

### Change 6: Track Global Registry Update (Line 3211)
**Location**: After saving global registry

```python
        with open(global_reg_path, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(global_reg, f, indent=2)
        global_registry_updated = True  # ADDED: Track for cleanup awareness
```

**Purpose**: Mark that global registry was modified (for logging purposes)

---

### Change 7: Comprehensive Exception Handler (Lines 3239-3273)
**Location**: Replace entire exception handler

**BEFORE**:
```python
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": f"Failed to deploy agent: {str(e)}"
        }
```

**AFTER**:
```python
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Agent deployment failed: {e}")
        logger.error(f"Cleaning up orphaned resources...")

        # Clean up tmux session if it was created
        if tmux_session_created:
            try:
                subprocess.run(['tmux', 'kill-session', '-t', tmux_session_created],
                             capture_output=True, timeout=5)
                logger.info(f"Killed orphaned tmux session: {tmux_session_created}")
            except Exception as cleanup_err:
                logger.error(f"Failed to kill tmux session: {cleanup_err}")

        # Remove orphaned prompt file
        if prompt_file_created and os.path.exists(prompt_file_created):
            try:
                os.remove(prompt_file_created)
                logger.info(f"Removed orphaned prompt file: {prompt_file_created}")
            except Exception as cleanup_err:
                logger.error(f"Failed to remove prompt file: {cleanup_err}")

        # Rollback registry changes (THIS WILL BE IMPROVED BY file_locking_implementer)
        # For now, log that registry may be corrupted
        if registry_updated or global_registry_updated:
            logger.error(f"Registry was partially updated before failure - may need manual cleanup")

        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": f"Failed to deploy agent: {str(e)}",
            "cleanup_performed": True,
            "resources_cleaned": {
                "tmux_session": tmux_session_created,
                "prompt_file": prompt_file_created
            }
        }
```

**Purpose**: Perform comprehensive cleanup of all created resources on failure

## Summary of Changes

| Change | Lines | Type | Impact |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| Resource tracking vars | 3067-3071 | Addition | Enable cleanup awareness |
| Track prompt_file | 3110 | Addition (1 line) | Mark file created |
| Track tmux_session | 3138 | Addition (1 line) | Mark session created |
| Early termination cleanup | 3145-3151 | Addition (7 lines) | Prevent leaked files |
| Track registry update | 3191 | Addition (1 line) | Logging awareness |
| Track global registry | 3211 | Addition (1 line) | Logging awareness |
| Exception handler | 3239-3273 | Replacement (35 lines) | Comprehensive cleanup |

**Total Lines Added**: ~50 lines
**Total Lines Replaced**: 4 lines (old exception handler)
**Net Addition**: ~46 lines

## Testing Impact

### No Behavioral Changes to Success Path
✅ All changes only affect error/failure paths
✅ Success path unchanged - no regression risk
✅ Backward compatible - return values preserved

### New Cleanup Behaviors
✅ Tmux sessions killed on deployment failure
✅ Prompt files removed on deployment failure
✅ Registry corruption logged for manual intervention
✅ Enhanced error return includes cleanup status

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- All changes in exception handlers (already failing scenarios)
- Each cleanup wrapped in try-except (defensive)
- No changes to success path
- Syntax validated with py_compile

### Benefits
- Prevents resource leaks
- Better debugging visibility
- Clean workspace on failures
- Coordinates with file locking implementation
