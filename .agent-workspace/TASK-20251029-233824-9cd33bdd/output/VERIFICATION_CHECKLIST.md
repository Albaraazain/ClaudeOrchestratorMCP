# Implementation Verification Checklist

  - **DONE**: Read lines 2845-3273 (function shifted in file)

- [x] ADD resource tracking variables at start of try block
  - **DONE**: Lines 3067-3071
  - prompt_file_created = None
  - tmux_session_created = None
  - registry_updated = False
  - global_registry_updated = False

- [x] SET tracking flags as resources are created
  - **DONE**: prompt_file_created = prompt_file (line 3110)
  - **DONE**: tmux_session_created = session_name (line 3138)
  - **DONE**: registry_updated = True (line 3191)
  - **DONE**: global_registry_updated = True (line 3211)

- [x] REPLACE catch-all exception handler with proper cleanup
  - **DONE**: Lines 3239-3273
  - Kills orphaned tmux sessions
  - Removes orphaned prompt files
  - Logs registry corruption warnings

- [x] ADD cleanup for immediate termination failure
  - **DONE**: Lines 3145-3151
  - Cleans up prompt_file when tmux session terminates immediately

- [x] TEST the changes by examining the code logic
  - **DONE**: Syntax check passed
  - **DONE**: Logic review completed
  - **DONE**: Edge cases analyzed

- [x] Document changes in output/RESOURCE_CLEANUP_IMPLEMENTATION.md
  - **DONE**: Comprehensive documentation created

## Code Quality Checks ✅

### Syntax & Imports
- [x] Python syntax valid (py_compile passed)
- [x] subprocess module imported (line 16)
- [x] All required modules available
- [x] No undefined variables

### Error Handling
- [x] Each cleanup wrapped in try-except
- [x] Cleanup failures logged
- [x] Cleanup failures don't block other cleanup
- [x] Defensive programming (existence checks)

### Logic Correctness
- [x] Tracking variables initialized before try block
- [x] Tracking variables set after successful operations
- [x] Cleanup only attempts if resource was created
- [x] Timeout on tmux kill prevents hanging (5 seconds)
- [x] File existence checked before removal

### Edge Cases
- [x] Resource not created (None check)
- [x] File doesn't exist (os.path.exists check)
- [x] Cleanup operation fails (individual try-except)
- [x] Multiple failures (all attempted, none block others)
- [x] Registry partial update (logged for manual fix)

## Integration Coordination ✅

### Respected Boundaries
- [x] Did NOT implement file locking (assigned to file_locking_implementer)
- [x] Did NOT implement registry rollback (waiting for file locking)
- [x] Added comment noting future improvement by other agent
- [x] Focused solely on resource cleanup (files and tmux sessions)

### Documentation
- [x] Integration notes explain coordination
- [x] Comments in code reference file_locking_implementer
- [x] Clear division of responsibility

## Testing Evidence ✅

### Syntax Validation
```bash
$ python3 -m py_compile real_mcp_server.py
(no output = success)
```
✅ PASSED

### Import Verification
```bash
$ grep "^import subprocess" real_mcp_server.py
16:import subprocess
```
✅ VERIFIED

### Logic Analysis
- **Scenario 1**: Prompt file creation fails
  - prompt_file_created = None
  - Exception handler: None check prevents cleanup attempt
  - ✅ CORRECT

- **Scenario 2**: Tmux session creation fails
  - prompt_file_created = <path>
  - tmux_session_created = None
  - Exception handler: Cleans prompt file only
  - ✅ CORRECT

- **Scenario 3**: Tmux session terminates immediately
  - prompt_file_created = <path>
  - tmux_session_created = <name>
  - Early termination block: Cleans prompt file
  - Returns error
  - ✅ CORRECT

- **Scenario 4**: Registry update fails
  - prompt_file_created = <path>
  - tmux_session_created = <name>
  - registry_updated = True
  - Exception handler: Cleans both, logs registry warning
  - ✅ CORRECT

- **Scenario 5**: Global registry update fails
  - All resources created
  - global_registry_updated = True
  - Exception handler: Cleans all, logs registry warning
  - ✅ CORRECT

- **Scenario 6**: Cleanup operation fails
  - Individual try-except catches failure
  - Logs error
  - Continues to next cleanup
  - ✅ CORRECT
