# Deduplication Implementation

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-29 23:39
**Implementer:** deduplication_implementer-233911-165fb8
**Task:** TASK-20251029-233824-9cd33bdd

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive deduplication checks to prevent duplicate agent spawns in the orchestrator system. This addresses a critical gap where multiple agents of the same type could be spawned for the same task, leading to redundant work and registry corruption.

## Implementation Details

### New Utility Functions Added

Three new utility functions were added to `real_mcp_server.py` before the `deploy_headless_agent` function:

#### 1. `find_existing_agent` (lines 2134-2155)

```python
def find_existing_agent(task_id: str, agent_type: str, registry: dict, status_filter: list = None) -> dict:
```

**Purpose:** Check if an agent of the same type already exists for a task.

**Logic:**
- Accepts a task registry and agent type
- Searches through all agents in the registry
- Returns the first agent matching the type with status in `['running', 'working']`
- Returns `None` if no matching agent found

**Usage:** Called at the beginning of `deploy_headless_agent` to prevent duplicate spawns.

#### 2. `verify_agent_id_unique` (lines 2157-2178)

```python
def verify_agent_id_unique(agent_id: str, registry: dict, global_registry: dict) -> bool:
```

**Purpose:** Verify that a generated agent_id doesn't already exist.

**Logic:**
- Checks both task registry and global registry
- Searches task registry's agents list for matching ID
- Searches global registry's agents dictionary for matching ID
- Returns `True` if unique, `False` if collision detected

**Usage:** Called by `generate_unique_agent_id` to verify each generated ID.

#### 3. `generate_unique_agent_id` (lines 2180-2213)

```python
def generate_unique_agent_id(agent_type: str, registry: dict, global_registry: dict, max_attempts: int = 10) -> str:
```

**Purpose:** Generate a guaranteed-unique agent ID with collision detection.

**Logic:**
- Generates ID with format: `{agent_type}-{HHMMSS}-{6-char-uuid}`
- Verifies uniqueness against both registries
- On collision, retries with microseconds added: `{agent_type}-{HHMMSS}{microseconds}-{6-char-uuid}`
- Supports up to 10 attempts before raising RuntimeError
- Handles timestamp collisions from rapid concurrent spawns

**Usage:** Replaces the simple ID generation in `deploy_headless_agent`.

### Integration into deploy_headless_agent

Modified `deploy_headless_agent` at lines 2582-2610:

**Before (line 2583):**
```python
# Generate agent ID and session name
agent_id = f"{agent_type}-{datetime.now().strftime('%H%M%S')}-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:6]}"
session_name = f"agent_{agent_id}"
```

**After (lines 2582-2610):**
```python
# Check for duplicate agents (deduplication)
existing_agent = find_existing_agent(task_id, agent_type, registry)
if existing_agent:
    logger.warning(f"Agent type '{agent_type}' already exists for task {task_id}: {existing_agent['id']}")
    return {
        "success": False,
        "error": f"Agent of type '{agent_type}' already running for this task",
        "existing_agent_id": existing_agent['id'],
        "existing_agent_status": existing_agent['status'],
        "note": "Use the existing agent or wait for it to complete before spawning a new one"
    }

# Load global registry for unique ID verification
workspace_base = get_workspace_base_from_task_workspace(workspace)
global_reg_path = get_global_registry_path(workspace_base)
with open(global_reg_path, 'r') as f:
    global_registry = json.load(f)

# Generate unique agent ID with collision detection
try:
    agent_id = generate_unique_agent_id(agent_type, registry, global_registry)
except RuntimeError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to generate unique agent ID: {e}")
    return {
        "success": False,
        "error": str(e)
    }

session_name = f"agent_{agent_id}"
```

## Deduplication Checks Performed

### 1. Duplicate Agent Type Check

**When:** Before spawning any new agent
**What:** Searches task registry for existing agent of same type
**Status Filter:** Only considers agents with status `running` or `working`
**Action on Match:** Returns error with existing agent details
**Benefit:** Prevents redundant work from multiple agents of same type

### 2. Agent ID Uniqueness Verification

**When:** During agent ID generation
**What:** Checks both task and global registries for ID collision
**Registries Checked:**
- Task registry: `workspace/AGENT_REGISTRY.json`
- Global registry: `workspace_base/registry/GLOBAL_REGISTRY.json`

**Action on Collision:** Regenerates ID with microseconds added
**Benefit:** Prevents ID collisions in rapid concurrent spawns

### 3. Timestamp Collision Handling

**Problem:** Old implementation used only `HHMMSS` timestamp, allowing collisions within same second
**Solution:** On first collision, adds microseconds to timestamp
**Format:** `{agent_type}-{HHMMSS}{microseconds}-{uuid}`
**Benefit:** Handles rapid spawns (multiple per second)

## Spawn Child Agent Coverage

The `spawn_child_agent` function (line 4658) automatically inherits deduplication:

```python
def spawn_child_agent(task_id: str, parent_agent_id: str, child_agent_type: str, child_prompt: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Delegate to existing deployment function
    return deploy_headless_agent.fn(task_id, child_agent_type, child_prompt, parent_agent_id)
```

Since it delegates to `deploy_headless_agent.fn()`, all deduplication logic applies automatically.

## Error Handling

### Duplicate Agent Detected

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Agent of type 'investigator' already running for this task",
  "existing_agent_id": "investigator-232523-be4f03",
  "existing_agent_status": "working",
  "note": "Use the existing agent or wait for it to complete before spawning a new one"
}
```

### Agent ID Generation Failure

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Failed to generate unique agent_id after 10 attempts"
}
```

This should be extremely rare and indicates severe registry corruption.

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Rapid Duplicate Spawn

**Scenario:** Attempt to spawn 2 agents of same type simultaneously
**Expected:** Second spawn returns error with existing agent details
**Command:**
```python
deploy_headless_agent(task_id, "investigator", "prompt 1")
deploy_headless_agent(task_id, "investigator", "prompt 2")  # Should fail
```

### Test 2: Rapid Concurrent Spawns (Different Types)

**Scenario:** Spawn 10 different agent types within same second
**Expected:** All succeed with unique IDs, no collisions
**Command:**
```python
for i in range(10):
    deploy_headless_agent(task_id, f"agent_type_{i}", f"prompt {i}")
```

### Test 3: ID Collision Recovery

**Scenario:** Artificially create ID collision scenario
**Expected:** System retries with microseconds and succeeds
**Method:** Mock `uuid.uuid4()` to return same value, verify retry logic

### Test 4: Zombie Agent Handling

**Scenario:** Agent marked as running but tmux session killed manually
**Expected:** Deduplication check blocks new spawn (as designed)
**Note:** Requires registry validation/repair to fix zombie first

## Integration with Other Fixes

### Coordinates with File Locking Agent

This deduplication implementation is **independent** of file locking but **complementary**:

- **Deduplication:** Prevents spawning duplicate agents logically
- **File Locking:** Prevents registry corruption from concurrent writes

Both are needed:
- Without deduplication: File locking prevents corruption but allows duplicate agents
- Without file locking: Deduplication prevents duplicates but registry can still corrupt

### Coordinates with Resource Cleanup Agent

Resource cleanup agent handles cleanup on deployment failures. Deduplication prevents the need to clean up duplicate agents by blocking them upfront.

### Coordinates with Redundant Loads Optimizer

The redundant loads optimizer is working on eliminating multiple registry reads. My implementation added one additional global registry read for ID verification. This should be refactored when the optimizer completes their work to use a single locked registry load.

## Known Limitations

### 1. No Automatic Zombie Cleanup

If an agent is marked as `running` but its tmux session doesn't exist (zombie), deduplication will still block spawning a new agent. This is by design - the zombie should be cleaned up first using registry validation/repair.

**Workaround:** Run registry validation to mark zombies as terminated before retrying spawn.

### 2. No Cross-Task Deduplication

Currently only prevents duplicate agents **within the same task**. Does not prevent spawning the same agent type for different tasks.

**Rationale:** Different tasks may legitimately need the same agent type.

### 3. Status Filter Hardcoded

The `find_existing_agent` function only considers agents with status `running` or `working`. Agents with status `completed`, `error`, or `terminated` are ignored.

**Rationale:** Completed/terminated agents don't represent active work, so spawning a new agent is acceptable.

## Performance Impact

### Registry Reads Added

- **Before:** 1 task registry read (line 2566)
- **After:** 2 registry reads (task registry at 2566, global registry at 2597)
- **Impact:** +1 file read per spawn (~1-5ms)

### Benefits

- **Prevented Duplicate Work:** Eliminates wasted CPU/memory from duplicate agents
- **Reduced Registry Corruption:** Fewer agents = fewer concurrent registry writes
- **Improved Task Clarity:** One agent per type makes progress tracking clearer

### Future Optimization

When file locking and atomic registry operations are implemented, both task and global registries can be loaded once within a single lock, reducing the overhead to zero.
