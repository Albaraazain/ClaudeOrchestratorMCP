# Immediate Cleanup Solution - Ready to Execute

**Status:** READY
**Created:** 2025-10-29 23:34
**Agent:** immediate_cleanup_builder-232530-7cf214

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Review what will be cleaned
./verify_cleanup.sh

# 2. Run the cleanup
./cleanup_leaked_agents.sh

# 3. Verify success
./verify_cleanup.sh
```

## What's Included

### 1. cleanup_leaked_agents.sh
- Safe cleanup script with user confirmation
- Kills leaked Claude processes (estimated: 0-5)
- Removes 87 ghost registry entries
- Updates registry counts to match reality
- **Location:** Project root directory
- **Executable:** Yes

### 2. verify_cleanup.sh
- Shows current system state
- Lists all active agents
- Checks registry synchronization
- Detects ghost agents
- **Location:** Project root directory
- **Executable:** Yes

### 3. IMMEDIATE_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md
- Complete documentation
- Problem summary
- Safety checks explained
- Step-by-step instructions
- Manual cleanup fallback
- **Location:** .agent-workspace/TASK-20251029-232447-3bf85ff8/output/

## Safety Features

✓ User confirmation required
✓ Preserves all active agent processes
✓ Safe JSON manipulation (Python-based)
✓ Shows what will be cleaned before execution
✓ Verification script to confirm success

## Expected Outcome

**Before:**
- Registry: 95 agents (87 ghosts)
- Processes: 49 Claude processes
- Sessions: 8 tmux sessions

**After:**
- Registry: 8 agents (0 ghosts)
- Processes: ~49 Claude processes (only leaked ones removed)
- Sessions: 8 tmux sessions

## Do NOT Run Cleanup If...

- You're unsure which agents should be preserved
- You want to inspect ghost agent data first
- You're waiting for an agent to complete
- You're in the middle of a deployment

## Next Steps After Cleanup

Once cleanup completes successfully, coordinate with other agents for:
1. Implement fcntl-based registry locking (registry_corruption_investigator finding)
2. Fix prompt_file cleanup on deployment failure (deployment_code_auditor finding)
3. Add automated cleanup on agent completion
4. Implement periodic health checks

## Files Created

- ✓ `.agent-workspace/TASK-20251029-232447-3bf85ff8/output/IMMEDIATE_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md`

**Ready to execute when user approves.**
