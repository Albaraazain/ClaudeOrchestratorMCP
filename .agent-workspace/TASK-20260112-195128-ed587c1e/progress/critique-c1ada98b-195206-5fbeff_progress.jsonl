Submitted 6 observations: architectural concerns (scope bug, refactoring needs), technical debt (nested logic), critical concern (blocks review process), praise (test deliverable met), and recommendations for immediate fix, testing, and long-term refactoring. Test phase successfully validated orchestrator capabilities despite exposing this critical bug in review submission path.", "progress": 100}
