Delivered comprehensive architecture with: 1) detect_project_context() function that scans 11+ config file types (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc) and detects language, frameworks, testing tools, and package managers, 2) format_project_context_prompt() that formats context with IMPLICATIONS and DO NOT constraints specific to detected project type, 3) Module-level caching strategy to avoid re-scanning (cache by absolute project path), 4) Integration strategy with exact line numbers (add functions at ~250-450, call at ~548, inject at ~571), 5) Complete implementation example for Python detection with FastMCP/pytest/pip. Design addresses investigator finding: agents work in vacuum without project context. Solution: Auto-detect and inject explicit PROJECT CONTEXT section telling agents what language/framework/testing they're working with. Performance target: <500ms detection. Error handling: Graceful degradation to 'Unknown' without blocking deployment. Coordinates with other architect designs: context goes BEFORE type-specific prompts, helps validation layer verify correct tools used. Total implementation: ~200 lines Python. All findings documented with detection patterns, data structures, prompt format examples, caching logic, and testing strategy.", "progress": 100}
