Delivered comprehensive architecture with: 1) Three specialized requirement functions (investigator, builder, fixer) encoding 6 senior engineer patterns from research, 2) Complete prompt content for each type with MANDATORY steps, SUCCESS criteria, EVIDENCE requirements, and ANTI-PATTERNS, 3) Dispatcher function for type routing with safe fallbacks, 4) Exact integration strategy with line numbers (add functions at ~303, dispatcher at ~556, inject at ~572), 5) Support for all agent types (investigator/builder/fixer/architect/quality_assurance) with intelligent mapping. Design addresses root causes identified by investigators: no type-specific guidance, no verification protocol, no enforcement mechanisms. Solution: Inject EXPLICIT, ENFORCEABLE, EVIDENCE-BASED requirements that force senior engineer thinking patterns. All 5 findings documented with complete implementation specifications, exact code structures, error handling, and backward compatibility strategy.", "progress": 100}
