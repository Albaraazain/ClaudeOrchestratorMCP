Successfully identified and documented 6 critical senior engineer thinking patterns with concrete, actionable behaviors: 1) Read-First Development (60-80% reading vs 20-40% writing), 2) Error-First Thinking (mental simulation of failure modes), 3) Completeness Mindset (rigorous definition of 'done'), 4) Skeptical Verification (question everything, verify assumptions), 5) Impact Radius Thinking (map dependencies and blast radius), 6) Ruthless Self-Review (critique own work before submission). Each pattern includes specific behaviors, automatic questions, verification checklists, and junior anti-patterns. All findings are implementable in agent prompts.", "progress": 100}
