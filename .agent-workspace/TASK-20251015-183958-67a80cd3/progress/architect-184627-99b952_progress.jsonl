Delivered comprehensive multi-layer validation architecture with 4 validation layers: 1) Workspace evidence checks (files modified, findings reported), 2) Type-specific validation (investigator needs findings, builder needs tests, fixer needs verification), 3) Self-reporting message validation (evidence keywords, minimum length, no TODOs), 4) Progress pattern validation (detect fake progress jumps). Implementation plan includes exact function signatures, integration points (lines 549, 600-603), code examples for each check, progressive enforcement strategy (warnings \u2192 blocking), and prompt section to communicate validation to agents. Design addresses root cause: agents currently trusted blindly without verification. Solution: Trust but verify - agents must PROVE completion with evidence, not just claim it. All findings documented with pseudocode, enforcement phases, false positive mitigation, and monitoring strategy.", "progress": 100}
