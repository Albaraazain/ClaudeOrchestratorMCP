RECOMMENDATION: DELETE create_agent_wrapper (lines 304-387) - it's dead code that conflicts with MCP self-reporting. Instead, strengthen agent prompts with: 1) Mandatory progress reporting frequency (every 3-5 min), 2) Explicit consequences for not reporting, 3) Evidence requirements for completion, 4) Self-review checklist before claiming done. The wrapper's batch-job model conflicts with MCP's autonomous-agent model. Commit to MCP and enforce it through prompts, not rigid phases. All findings documented with rationale and integration points.", "progress": 100}
