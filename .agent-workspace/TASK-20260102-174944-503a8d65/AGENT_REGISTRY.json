The workspace shows no code artifacts, no test results, no documentation, and no findings from any build agents. The 5-second duration between phase creation and review submission confirms no meaningful work occurred. This appears to be a test of the agentic review system itself rather than an actual build phase. A legitimate Build phase would require: (1) implemented code in project files, (2) test results confirming functionality, (3) build/compilation success evidence, (4) documentation of changes made, and (5) agent findings documenting the work performed. None of these are present. RECOMMENDATION: Either perform actual build work with proper deliverables, or close this as a test task.",
