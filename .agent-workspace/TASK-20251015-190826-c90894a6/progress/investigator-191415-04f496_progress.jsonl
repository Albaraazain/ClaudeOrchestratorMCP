RESULTS: NO project context received in my prompt - fix did NOT work. ROOT CAUSE: The orchestrator (or Claude Code MCP client) does NOT pass client_cwd when calling create_real_task(). The server-side fix is correct but incomplete - the CLIENT must be updated to pass client_cwd=os.getcwd() to create_real_task(). Without this, the registry stores null, and the fallback logic fails to find the project directory. The feature is BROKEN END-TO-END until the MCP client integration is fixed. Files that need fixing: Whatever code calls mcp__claude-orchestrator__create_real_task - must add client_cwd parameter.", "progress": 100}
