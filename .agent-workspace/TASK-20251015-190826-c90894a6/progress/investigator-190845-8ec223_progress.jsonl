ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: real_mcp_server.py:1110 uses os.getcwd() which returns MCP server's working directory, NOT the client project directory. Since MCP server runs in a different location (likely ~/.config or user home), detect_project_context() never finds pyproject.toml. The context dict returns language='Unknown', which SHOULD still inject a fallback prompt, but even THAT prompt is missing from my agent_prompt file. This suggests format_project_context_prompt() is either returning empty string OR context_prompt variable is somehow being cleared before prompt construction. Evidence: agent_prompt_investigator-190845-8ec223.txt lines 68-70 are completely blank where context should be. Fix required: Pass client_cwd from create_real_task() to deploy_headless_agent() and use that for context detection instead of os.getcwd().", "progress": 100}
