Root cause confirmed: Line 1104 uses os.getcwd() which returns MCP server directory, not client project. Additionally, client_cwd from create_real_task() is NOT stored in AGENT_REGISTRY.json, so deploy_headless_agent() has no way to retrieve it. Fix: Store client_cwd in registry during task creation, then read it in deploy_headless_agent().", "progress": 25}

Modified real_mcp_server.py:976 to store client_cwd in task registry, and lines 1105-1118 to read client_cwd from registry and use it for context detection instead of os.getcwd(). Includes backward-compatible fallback logic that extracts client directory from workspace path. The fix ensures agents receive proper PROJECT CONTEXT by detecting from the client's project directory (where pyproject.toml exists) rather than the MCP server's working directory.
